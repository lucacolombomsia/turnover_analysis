Project charter   
A high turnover rate can seriously impact our company’s ability to be successful, as it causes
high monetary costs and losses of human capital. The goal of this project is to enable HR
professionals and team managers to work conjunctly to retain the best talent. Our model will
predict the likelihood that current employees will leave the company and will help understand
what are the most relevant reasons behind an employee’s decision to voluntary terminate his
employment – for example: low satisfaction, excessive workload, lack of career progression.   

Vision : increase employee retention and reduce the turnover rate, with a particular focus on
reducing the number of high-performers that voluntarily leave.    
Mission : develop a model that evaluates the probability that each employee will quit and that
helps inform the decision of team managers on whether or not to take action –and which action
to take– to mitigate employee flight risk.    
Success criteria : a satisfactory level across multiple metrics that measure classification
accuracy. The longer term goal is to observe a measurable increase in the ability to retain
employees that are highly valued by their managers.
